# Commit Template

Here is a useful template with guidelines to ensure commits are clear, consistent, and informative. 

1. Summary line: A short summary (50 characters or less) of what this commit includes.

2. Body: Separated by a line from the summary, this is the space for outlining each change or addition that was performed in this commit.

3. Tip: When writing the body, use the imperative mood. Write the commit message as if you're giving a command (e.g. "Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug"). This goes along with common convention.

4. Explain the "what" and "why": elaborate on what was done and why, especially if the "why" isn't immediately obvious from the code changed. Don't explain how, as that should be clear from the code.

5. Try to limit the body text to 72 characters: This makes it easier to read in different git interfaces.

6. References or pull requests: If the commit is related to a particular issue or PR, include it below the body. The same goes for task ID's in Jira.

7. Include context if significant changes are made. What was the motivation for making these changes? (use only for significang changes, like refactoring, breaking changes, or complex new functionality).

Here's the commit template:

#<50-character summary line>
#Blank line
#Detailed description of the change:
